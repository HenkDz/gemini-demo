# 🚀 Go-to-Market Plan & Website Audit: PaidBasis

**Date:** December 25, 2025
**Strategy:** "The Anti-Spreadsheet" & "The Consultant Portal"

---

## 1. Website Audit: Is PaidBasis.com "Perfect"?

**Overall Score: 8.5/10 (Strong Foundation, Missed SEO Hooks)**

| Element | Status | Critique & Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hero Copy** | 🟡 Good | "Automated Commission Tracking" is clear but safe. **Fix:** Be bolder. Use the emotional hook found in research. <br> *Suggestion:* "Stop calculating Xero commissions in Excel. 100% automated, paid-on-collection." |
| **Keywords** | ⚠️ Missing | Detailed scan shows you are missing the exact high-volume search phrases: <br> • **"Spreadsheet Hell"** (The emotional pain point) <br> • **"Paid on Collection"** (The specific technical term users search for) |
| **Pricing** | ✅ Perfect | The single tier is clear and frictionless. |
| **Consultant Persona** | ❌ Missing | You are effectively invisible to the "Independent Consultant" market we just discovered. **Fix:** Add a dedicated "For Consultants" landing page. |

## 2. Pricing Validation: Is $49/mo Fair?

**Verdict: Aggressively Fair / High-Value Wedge**

*   **Your Price:** **$49/mo flat** (up to 10 reps).
*   **Competitor A (Sales Cookie):** ~$30/user/mo = **$300/mo** for 10 reps.
*   **Competitor B (Commissionly):** ~$25/user/mo = **$250/mo** for 10 reps.

**Analysis:**
You are **6x - 8x cheaper** than the competition for a team of 10.
*   **Pros:** This makes you a "No Brainer" purchase for an SMB owner. It removes the friction of "per seat" licensing.
*   **Cons:** You might be *underpricing* the value for "Consultants" who manage 5+ clients.
*   **Recommendation:** Keep the $49/mo for the "Internal Team" (SMB). Introduce a **$99/mo "Pro Advisor" Plan** later for consultants who want to connect *unlimited* client organizations.

## 3. Marketing Plan: "The Bookkeeper Wedge"

### **Strategy A: The "Spreadsheet Killer" Content Campaign**
Focus on the *pain* of the manual process, not just the features of the software.

*   **Hook:** "Why your Excel Commission Calculator is costing you $500/month in hidden errors."
*   **Channel:** Reddit (r/xero, r/smallbusiness, r/bookkeeping).
*   **Tactic:** Monitor for keywords like "partial payment", "commission tracking", "xero addon". Reply with helpful advice first, then link your tool.

### **Strategy B: The "Xero Partner" Network**
Bookkeepers are the gatekeepers. They are the ones doing the manual work.
*   **Action:** Create a "Partner One-Pager" PDF.
*   **Pitch:** "Stop spending 5 hours reconciling commissions for your clients. Install PaidBasis and give them a self-serve portal."
*   **Outreach:** Search LinkedIn for "Xero Advisor" or "Fractional CFO".
